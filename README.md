# tic-tac-toe

This was a project I undertook to get practice and get a firm understanding of factory functions, IIFE modules and closures

## Possible Improvements

- Allow users to add their names manually
- Add a score counter for the number of times won
- Fix visual offset bug when an icon is added to the gameboard
- Refactor code to use less if statements
